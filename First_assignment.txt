Hello Students,

This is what you have to do for homework.
Remember the deadline to submit the HW is Wenesday at 8:00:00 am.

I. Read chapter 2 from the book Introduction to Scientific Computing for Biologists Author.   
The book is downloadable here: https://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IntroSciComp2014.pdf

II. Answer the following question. What does this do?   

1. ls [A-Z]* - Lists all files with only uppercase characters. # Correct!
2. cp *.sh /tmp - Copies the temporary file, * means there are zero or more characters that follow, used to find specific directories or text files # Correct! But `*` is actually a wildcard to print whatever .sh file
3. man pwd - Shows the help page of a command, in this case "pwd" which indicates a pathway # Correct!
4. cd ~ - Takes you back to your home directory # Correct!
5. mkdir -p /test1/test2/test3 - Creates multiple directories at once, would create a successive line of directories and files # Correct! But mkdir will do that. Waht is `-p` doing ???
6. cp -r /tmp . - Copies a directory recursively, with all of the sub-directories and files, "tmp" indicates a temporary file # Correct!
7. ls | less - Lists the first two lines of files with a matching pattern, then progressively prints the files that are found and on the screen. # Correct!
8. head -n 24 test.txt Â» abc.txt - Prints/Shows the first few lines of a text file, appends the output from test.txt to abc.txt, if abc.txt does not exist then it will be created. # Correct!
9. echo "aaa" > aaa.txt - Appends the "aaa" string to the already existing file aaa.txt # Correct!
10. ps -u sallesina - Gives a list of possible commands, rules, functions, and options, must type username with ps -u # Correct!Try it with your username in hoffman
11. top - Indicates everyone that is working within the same node, Shows information including Command, Time, %MEM, %CPU, SHR, VIRT, NI, PR, and User # Correct!
12. ls | grep .sh | xargs mv /tmp - Lists the first two lines of files with a matching pattern, takes the file name passed to xargs and encodes the desired final file name, removes any unnecessary temporary files
# Incorrect! Takes output of ls (files) names and sends the names into grep. Grep then will search the shell for these specific directories or files and send located ones as input to xargs mv /tmp command which adds the files output by grep to the tmp folder. 
13. du -sk /home/* | sort -r -n | head -10 - Prints files in a current directory, sorts all lines using numeric values and head prints the first few lines of the sorted files, commands are used to find and read  particular files. # Correct!
14. sort -r names.txt - Sort the names of the text files alphabetically, reverse the result of comparisons. # Correct!
